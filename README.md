# Hitori mobile Game
*Made by Amandine Carlier and William Denorme*
### Rules :
Hitori is played with a grid of squares or cells, with each cell initially containing a number. The game is played by eliminating squares/numbers and this is done by blacking them out. The objective is to transform the grid to a state wherein all three following rules are true:
- no row or column can have more than one occurrence of any given number
- black cells cannot be horizontally or vertically adjacent, although they can be diagonal to one another.
- the remaining numbered cells must be all connected to each other, horizontally or vertically.
